fastgenematch
=============

fast one to one gene symbol matching with customizable configurations. 
for development of tools with frequent gene mapping.

Goals:
1, completely local tools to do very fast O(1) lookup of any gene symbol to any other gene id format
1.1,semi fuzzy lookup rules hardcoded for the id structure.
2, ability to prebrew data files from vendors and generate one to one conversion bin dicts
3, python wrapper
4, to be used to speed up crick.

Future:
5, run as daemon
6, run in parallel
